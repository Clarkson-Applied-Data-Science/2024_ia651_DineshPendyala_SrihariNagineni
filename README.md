## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various patient features. The analysis involves:

1. Data preprocessing and PCA transformation.
2. Model training using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation.
3. Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
4. Visualization of results.
